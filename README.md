# Crafting
A Java clone of Flash Player-Game <strong>Minecraft: Crafting</strong> made using JavaFX 8

> Not affiliated with Mojang Studios

Here you can play the original game: https://vseigru.net/igry-majnkraft/18772-igra-majnkraft-krafting.html

P.S. I do not know the original creator of this game.

# Running
If you have Java 8 installed, then download Crafting.jar and run it from <br/>
command line using ```java -jar Crafting.jar```. Since it is a JavaFX application <br/>
it does not launch from double-click.

If you have Java 11 or higher, then it will not be so simple,
search how to do it on YouTube or clone the repository and run it in an IDE.
